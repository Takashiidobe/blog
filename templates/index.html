    <h2><a href="https://resume.takashiidobe.com/">Resume</a></h2>

    <h2>Welcome ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer at
      <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>, working on the storage layer of tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to working at Zendesk, I was a software engineer at
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, working on visualization and
      ingestion of sales data in order to reduce toil on our sales pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to working at Amazon, I worked at
      <a href="https://www.cardflight.com/">CardFlight</a>, a startup based out
      of New York City that is building payments software for small businesses.
      I mostly worked on the backend where I got to implement the specifications
      of payment processors into our gateway, and sometimes contribute to our
      mobile SDKs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I became a software developer, I worked at a variety of positions
      including a startup called
      <a href="http://www.frasen.io/">Frasen</a> where I worked with the
      executive team to raise capital, as a chef at
      <a href="https://hachibei.com/">Yakitori Hachibei</a>, and taught English
      at <a href="https://gengoworld.com/">GengoWorld</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a web developer at heart, but like learning about computer science. In
      particular, I enjoy learning about Operating Systems, Functional
      Programming, and Distributed Systems.
