We are addicted to debt. Debt, along with its sibling, capital, runs modern economics, so it shouldn't be surprising, but I hear a lot of misconceptions about debt with regards to companies, which is what I'll discuss more here. Banking companies taking advantage of poor debtors, (a very real problem) will be out of scope for this post -- I'll discuss how companies and leaders should look at debt, and how prospective workers at these companies should look at a company's finances to find out how fiscally responsible the company is (i.e., how likely it is to go bankrupt and shutter operations).

I had a conversation with a firm that seemed like they were doing interesting and technical engineering work. Everything was going well, so I figured I would ask them about their finances; this company was a startup, and so did not have public finances. I saw that they had borrowed a large sum of money to begin financing (50M+) so I asked them what their plan was going forward. The person I was talking to didn't have a good answer; after all, they were a stealth company with an empty website, and a lot of what I was told was extremely vague. Soon enough the conversation devolved into discussing how the firm I was working for was worth less than this firm, and how they were smashing growth metrics and how I would regret not working for them. All with a stub website. I had tried to politely end the conversation, as things had turned south, but the firm representative wanted to continue telling stories of how great the company was. All with a stub website and 50M in debt. The representative was keen on telling me that his firm was worth more than the firm I worked for, all with a stub website and 50M in debt.

You see, in my past life, I worked for the investing arm of a bank (basically a VC), going around Tokyo to various startup pitch competitions and trying to gather information for the bank to see if we wanted to invest. YC has their own guidelines for investment; we had ours. I was a frontline salesman, trying to see if these startups were stable and worthy for investment. In much the Japanese way, this meant going to bars with founding teams of startup firms, asking about financials, and seeing if the founder knew roughly what they were doing, which meant having a roadmap and wanting funding (not all firms wanted funding, or to be funded by us, which makes sense). If the founders passed my screening, one of my seniors would talk more in-depth, and then his senior would talk to the startup, and if everyone agreed to the terms, they would sign a contract and exchange money for stock.

My questions weren't hard at all, it was mostly making sure that the team had cohesion and the founder was motivated, with a forward trajectory. Nothing else. The firms I turned down mostly had a penchant for BS, which could be found in their pitch decks, where they would promise extravagantly without any reasoning. When pressed on this, they would BS some more, which didn't work out for most startups I met. Maybe it worked for some? Some of the other firms were way too loose with their money; they had diluted their stock far too much, and would never make it public. They didn't grow fast enough with regard to their capital investment, and so were risky investments, and we passed on those.

There is, however, no silver bullet. The firm that you perceive to be too loose with its money could be the next WeWork or Uber, which netted their investors large sums of money. The investment firm I worked for would never invest in firms like that. We valued stable investments, which means lower risk and lower reward.

I talked to some folks around my age, who were software developers, and told them about the first story. A few of them told me I was in the wrong for doubting this stealth firm, and said that working for a company that wasn't borrowing large sums of money was uninteresting, and in general, a waste of time to work for.

I asked them if they thought Google or Facebook still borrowed large money and were largely uninteresting to work for, and one doubled down and said that earning money was not one of the goals of a company, since they could be financed by debt forever.

What a world we live in.

To be fair, another one told me how he balanced what kind of firms to work for.

|        | Startup with lots of Debt | Startup without (much) Debt | (Public) Firm |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Risk   | High                      | Low                         | Low           |
| Reward | High                      | Low                         | Medium        |

This seems to make sense.

But I disagree on the conflation of debt and growth here. Capital investment only works on certain problems; as such, firms have an optimal amount of debt they should be taking on, where when the marginal value of capital becomes 0 (i.e. when getting into more debt does not earn you more value than the cost of said debt). Some business problems are capital intensive, where your business problem requires a lot of research and developers to solve it. These firms get more use out of taking on debt, so they should take on more debt. Other firms solve a problem that isn't capital intensive; where if they took on more debt, it would just sit in their coffers doing nothing. These firms have no use for excess capital, and thus, should avoid large amounts of debt, since it quickly becomes a liability for them.

We've lost sight on how to value companies these days. Ray Dalio would cry about how people forgot how to do value investment.

Valuation spurred on by Debt is not Valuation.

The company I worked for has a 10M valuation or so, because it took on 10M in debt. The company I talked to had 50M in debt, so it must have a value of at least 50M.

I passed up a company that is worth 5x more than my current company!

If a company decides to sell off stock for debt, they are worth at least as much as their debt.
