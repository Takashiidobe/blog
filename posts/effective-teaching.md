Learning is so important that (most of us) spend our waking hours from ages 5-18 taking mandatory schooling provided by the government, and some of us (at our own personal expense) spend 4+ more years of our lives trying to educate ourselves in higher education institutions. We take it for granted that we spend time to learn, but I think we spend little time on the spirit of learning -- teachers tell schoolchildren what they need to learn "just because", but rarely elaborate on the real life implications of said subjects, or why the student should be engaged.

The education system has failed us. At the same time there is a greater emphasis on learning facts and being "correct", teachers have decided to decrease the amount of learning spent by discussion, instead focusing more on multiple choice quizzes instead of open-ended questions.

This is a shame. Not because I believe schooling as it stands is a waste of time, but rather that I believe that any education that does not focus on the "spirit" of education fails to inform its students of the reasons why they should invest their time and participate in learning as an activity.

Students in mandatory schooling are taught more to memorize ideas than they are to think and engage critically. Some of that has to do with the fact that education is expensive to provide -- in America, most every city has a set of schools which provide education to students in grades 1-6, 6-9, and 9-12. You can't guarantee quality education if there is a necessity to hire so many teachers, and the quality rightly varies given that some cities are poorer than others, and thus less able to provide teachers with the monetary support needed to live a good life. There are many other reasons why quality in-person education is difficult to provide, but I think this is more a problem of bureaucracy chasing the wrong problem; education doesn't start with a hierarchical relationship of a teacher teaching a student, it starts with the student wanting to learn. In fact, the student and teacher can be the same person, given some other requirements are met.

Quality resources are required outside of instruction to meet the bar of a quality education. In science class, students are required to mix chemicals in beakers and abide by security protocol to understand how to safely and properly conduct exploratory scientific investigation. In Civics classes, you ready many first-person accounts and second-person accounts of an event/perspective and discuss critically what is correct or incorrect about the event or perspective. In Math classes you discuss and learn proofs and correctly solve problems. In language classes, you read, write, and speak the targeted language, receiving instruction on how to improve. All of these subjects boil down to having good instruction to inform the student or learner how to improve, and having the student execute on that feedback. So you can't cut out the teacher from the equation, can you?

You can. For the subjects above, the teacher is unnecessary as long as you have quality instructive materials. Reading a good textbook which clearly explains the in-and-outs of a topic, with extra resources to look up for curious students is just about all you need for topics that aren't hands-on. If time permits, reading from more than one textbook, more than one primary or secondary source is even better.

You might ask about the hands-on component of learning, and I agree -- you need this in your education. But it's not hard to get either -- textbooks can and should provide a recipe book for ingredients that you fetch (1 pack of gold foil, one light) along with steps you do to learn about the lab.

If we boil down education to just reading from a book and believing what the author says, however, we'd be in big trouble. What happens if the author is wrong, or teaches outdated materials? We need some way to vet educational materials, which isn't hard for a country -- have some scholars recommend some textbooks that they enjoy to the school systems, who know that they can trust such eminent scholars of the field. But what happens if you don't go to school anymore? I certainly don't.

You're not out of luck -- you can still learn how to learn. Feynman, a Nobel prize-winning physicist, had many thoughts on teaching which he conveniently distilled for us, which is good, because learning is the most important skill you will use in your life. Teaching is the second most important skill you will use in your life, because you cannot learn unless you teach yourself, and you will have nothing to teach yourself unless you learn. They are like two sides of a coin.

The Feynman learning technique involves the following four steps:

1. Choose a concept to learn
2. Explain it to someone with no knowledge of the subject
3. Identify gaps in your explanation -> These are the gaps in your understanding
4. Review and Simplify

As well, Feynman noted that there are two types of knowledge:

1. Knowing the name of something
2. Understanding

The only way to know you understand something is to be able to explain it without knowledge of the concept to understand. If you can't explain the concept without using the word itself, you need to go back to the drawing board.

Teaching is important to learn because of this:

-- Add a point on how to teach with random paced repetition, open ended quizzes on subjects.
