Dark matter constitutes nonluminous material that is **postulated** to exist in space and that could take any of several forms including weakly interacting particles or high-energy randomly moving particles.

There's a lot of dark matter out there. CERN believes that dark matter outweighs visible matter ~6 to 1. Dark matter makes up over a quarter of the universe, whereas the matter we know makes up about 5% of the universe.

In a macro view of the universe, there's so much that we don't know and won't know for a long time. We focus on the matter that we see, and ignore the matter we don't.

We have this hardwired in our brains. The fundamental attribution error means that we over-emphasize character traits to explain behavior in others, while under-emphasizing situational factors.

There's dark matter at the micro-level too. We can barely explain how the brain works, how it conjures up differing realities from a similar enough environment. We're unsure about how we acquire language, just that we do, and the characteristics of it. We treat the brain like a black box, like dark matter. Stimuli goes in, perception comes out. We jot that down and try to tie our knowledge together to understand the brain more as a whole.

In between the micro and macro, there's a lot of dark matter too. When you ask someone to explain something they can't explain, they might shrug their shoulders and say it "just is". Why do we yearn to create, to relax and to strive? Why do we care about how we live and what we do? We just do. 

Meteorologists know it best, given how much they must predict the future, and how often those predictions fall flat. It is diabolically hard to create a model that predicts the weather properly, even a few days in advance. All of your measurements could point to tomorrow being 70 degrees, but theres unforeseen weather that causes your prediction to be off.

Finance people know it second best. Outside of some bouts of collective insanity (sorry, enthusiasm), it's impossible to predict the winners. Every day is filled with dark matter, with price fluctuations that are governed by hopes, algorithms, and the speed of light and networks adding volatility to markets. 

As we get better at math, we learn how to filter out important data from less important data, and make more robust models to understand the world. But we can only collect data from and reason about a small portion of the world. There's a lot that we can't sense.

Philosophers have tried to lead the way in order to explain the good life and answer the question of what makes life worth living. They fashioned model lives like lighthouses to lead us on the good path to fulfillment. In their wake, they crafted the idea of collectives of idealized people, and tenets for how they should lead. And yet, we have failed to find that mold. Because we'll never find a mold that fits the various shapes of the human experience.

In algorithms research, there's plenty that's been said about impossibility. Many algorithms have proven bounds on how fast they can run in a worst case situation. The real world has hard bounds on the bounds of our knowledge. We can work to improve our understanding, but without a paradigm shift, there's only so much we can know.
