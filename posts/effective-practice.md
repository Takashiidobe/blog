People who practice more tend to be better at what they do. Pretty straightforward -- if you're a professional chess player, you want to practice lots of chess. If you play music, you want to practice plenty of music. If you're a writer you write. Likewise, improving at programming requires practicing the craft of programming.

The first step to improving at something? Acknowledging that you want to do it. If you don't want to improve at something, you won't improve. You'll have to find the reason to pull the metaphoric sword out of the stone. I'll wait for you to decide on that.

If the first step is the why, the second step is the where. Where do you want to improve? Do you want to be better at CSS? Do you want to know what a compiler does? Do you want to learn about Databases? Computer Networks? Find some resources to practice improving your skill -- if it involves computer networks, fire up wireshark and start looking at packets across the wire, and writing your own servers and clients. If it involves compilers, write a compiler or interpreter for a small language, and learn about the steps. For CSS? Time to build some websites. And that's about it.

The people who are the most effective at what they do have to learn from other people. Obviously, other people have done exactly what we've done, found out how to distill their knowledge into something useful for others, and published said information in a book or some other medium. We want to find the best of the best of those resources and read those, so we can improve the fastest. How do we get there? find some well vetted classics of the field, and read only from those, working your way down to less famous works as you achieve a sense of improvement.
