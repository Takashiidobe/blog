Quentin Tarantino has insisted upon retiring after directing his 10th movie for decades now; Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was the 9th film he directed, which means his next film (his 10th) will be his last.

Why would a director spend three decades building a cult following and throw it all away at the peak of his fame?

He's directed 9 films between 1992 and 2019, at the rate of a film every three years. He slotted out 10 3-year projects for himself, and has successfully executed on that goal. After making his 10th film, he'll go about his merry way writing some film books or theatre, but no more blockbuster films for Mr. Tarantino.

Which led me to a thought. No matter how long we work for, almost everyone only has 10 projects worth of time to work on. If you work for 40 years from 25-65, you only have ten four year projects for yourself. Your projects build upon each other, like a staircase, until you reach your final projects, which should be the most insightful and ambitious; just like fine wine ages gracefully, each project should last longer than the last, and be more wide ranging in impact.

Which leads me to myself; I'm nearing 25, which means I need to start my first four year project soon. As a programmer, there's a lot of ways to get started on your first project, and you can work on them concurrently, just as Tarantino directed his film while writing his next film. I'm not sure what it could be, but I'm not super worried; while I bide my time, I can work on learning the fundamentals of programming so I can work on more challenging things.

If you understand the analogy of each project building upon the last in scope and impact, you'll see that it's a fool's errand for a beginner like me to start guessing what my 10th project will be or even my 5th; maybe I can see what I'll be doing for my next project or so, but definitely not in 20 years time. But that doesn't preclude me from thinking about some ideas that might make it into the future.

## A new Programming Language

I am a big fan of programming languages -- I work in ruby although I've tried almost every mainstream programming language I could get my hands on. I'm not well versed in Programming Language Theory (PLT for those in the know) but I've found that many languages have good ideas that it would be nice if they were mixed and matched in a different way. But I want to work on a programming language that has low-level performance and control, with high-level language ergonomics. Rust is the closest contender in this regard; it has high-level constructs for almost everything you'd want, but lets you dabble in as much low-level code as you need to if you so desire.

That being said, Rust is currently missing a few things that I need for it to be "the perfect" programming language for me -- one is the compile times. Even an incremental build on Rust can take 1 minute + on my computer in a project with just a few dependencies, given that my daily driver is a low end Macbook pro from 2017. As well, the cache can take up a lot of space for incremental artifacts that Rust builds to speed up compile times.

This is where having an interpreter for the language like in the case of Python would really be neat. You could have a language that is fast in production, but also fast in prototyping. Go is basically there, with blazing fast compiles for fast prototyping, but I dislike some of the rules (like no unused imports blocking compilation). I also dislike some of the trades that Go took to make its language more clean, like no generics and weird `if != err` error checking.

I think there's plenty of research that has been done on languages to make a clean, modern, and well thought out language which can remove some of the cruft from yesteryear. Maybe something like Clojure, or a new ML?
