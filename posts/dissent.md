Metrics lie -- dissent doesn't mean you're doing poorly as an entity -- people who think critically are more likely to dissent, so having a high satisfaction rate tends to mean that the population either isn't thinking critically/can't think critically (more likely/ votes are rigged).

In that way, worse is almost always better.
