Back to the Future paints an optimistic look of the future; by 2015 you could turn your old terrestrial car into a flying car for \$100! Of course that didn't come true; we are now five years past 2015 and no one's car soars the sky. Predictions of the future are difficult to get right, especially over a long enough timeline. So yes, again, that's exactly what we'll do. We'll look at what the future of work could be in a short time frame (5-10 years), medium time frame (10-50 years) and in a longer time frame (50-100 years), and see the rippling effects on society as a whole.

## The Short Term

In the short term, I expect little change to come about; when smartphones became accessible in the late 2000s, they created a product boom.
