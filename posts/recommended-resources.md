## Links

- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/) Learn how to program network sockets in C.

## Courses

- [MIT Performance Engineering of Software Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/) A good course to learn more about computer architecture and what's going on under the hood when you execute code.
- [Design and Implementation of Programming Languages](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2022/cmsc430/index.html): A course that introduces compilers, implementing a compiler that emits x86 assembly.
- [The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/index.html) A course that thoroughly explains useful algorithms and what they can be used for, with lots of real world examples.

## Books

- [Algorithms for Modern Hardware](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/): A great resource for learning about performance sensitive tasks.
