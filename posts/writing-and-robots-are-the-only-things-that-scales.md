Few words are as pervasive in software development as scale. The word has even leaked out of software development; when I talk to startups, all they seem to care about is how they scale. When I talk to VCs, all they care about is how their portfolio scales. Nowadays, people put a premium on scale -- Tesla is now the most valuable car maker in the world, while only selling 350k cars in 2019. Toyota sold 10.6 million cars in 2019 and turned higher profits. Amazon is worth more than Walmart, despite making little profit.

In the business world, scalability implies lean sales. Toyota dominated the manufacturing world of yesteryear with their Just In Time manufacturing, high quality parts, and global distribution. But that model requires more humans than Tesla's current model. It doesn't scale quite as well. The fundamentals of yesterday are out. Scale, business plans and hopes sell better than that. This is the new normal.

We'll have to see how it pans out, but I don't dislike this turn of events. If you can scale, you have a business plan for the future -- you have ambitions. If your favorite company makes up business plans as they grow, maybe it's a short-term rent seeking company that will never be worth as much as Tesla.

But that's not the topic of today's blog. Instead of discussing how the concept of scale has changed, I want to think about how to maximize scale, in all its forms, for the business of the future. COVID-19 threw a wrench in the plans of businesses who weren't able to adapt. You don't just need scale now, you need a flexible business. And it's odd how both of those things are in contention, yet the very best companies manage to do both. You need to find a way to use scale to maximize flexibility. Writing and robots are the only way to do that.

## Communication

Gone are the days when suits would smoke a cigar in a meeting room, fly in executives across the country, spend lavishly on golf course excursions and throwing galas. It just doesn't scale. If your company is of a reasonable size (< 10000 people), maybe you can fly in the top brass every once in a while. But what if you had a company of a million people? Or 10 million? Surely you wouldn't want to spend all that money to bring them in to have a conversation with each other. That would be expensive. And expensive is the opposite of scale, which is cheap.

Of course this happened all the time in the empires of old -- barons and lords and nobility would come to the ruler's palace every once in a while to be report and learn about how the empire was progressing.

But what happens if you want worldwide dominance? Never mind those small empires of a few hundred thousand people, the empires of millions are the ones that write, and organize.

If I were to name three influential empires in the west, they would be the Catholics, the Protestants, and the Muslims. They all are bound by writing. This isn't anything unique to the west, or religions -- the Egyptians, the Babylonians, Romans, Greeks, Indians, Chinese, Carthaginians all wrote.

You can't unite an empire by having face to face meetings -- you need to have some way to bind and define your culture.
