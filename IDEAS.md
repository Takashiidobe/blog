- Why Cross Compile?
- Personal workflow
- Cross compilation for Rust with libraries
- Using Dart for Cross Compilation
- Working Offline

  Cross compilation and POSIX compatibility for C.

- The difference between a priori (logic), a posteriori (empiricism) and
  soft science (that which should be a posteriori, but are too complex
  to know are deterministic).
- Bets as expression, and why you should bet on things (and why systems
  that aren't "bettable" in ways that allow a full range of human
  expression are flawed). And the three points: (I'm a fan, I don't
  care, I'm against). Morality as freedom from and freedom to, vs. bets
